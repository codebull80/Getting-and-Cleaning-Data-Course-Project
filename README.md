# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project



This repository is my contribution for the course project Getting and Cleaning Data. 
It's code runs analysis on the Human Activity Recognition dataset.


## Files

CodeBook.md is a text file that details the variables, data, and any transformations performed

run_analysis.R prepares the data, which is then followed by the five processes outlined in the course project's definition:
Combines the training and test sets into a single data set.
Only the mean and standard deviation readings for each measurement are extracted.
The activities in the data collection are given descriptive activity names.
Label the data collection appropriately with meaningful variable names.
Based on this data it creates a second, separate tidy data set  with the mean of each variable for each activity and subject.
After going through all of the aforementioned procedures, the exported final data is TidyStudyData.txt.
